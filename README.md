## ⚡ Quick Start

**Cracken V5** replaces hours of manual Linux configuration with a single command. 
Run this on a fresh VPS (Ubuntu/Debian) as `root`:

```bash
bash <(curl -s [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owneraniex/Cracken-BASH/main/Loader.sh](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owneraniex/Cracken-BASH/main/Loader.sh))
````

> **🔒 Security Note:** This command initiates our **Secure Loader**, which verifies your server environment before retrieving the encrypted, binary-compiled installer payload.

-----

## 💎 Why Cracken?

Most installers are simple Bash scripts that break easily. **Cracken V5** is a compiled **Go Application** designed for stability and security.

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🏎️ Turbo Engine** | Written in **Golang**. Executes logic 10x faster than standard shell scripts. Zero lag. |
| **🛡️ Binary Lock** | Source code is compiled into machine code. Your installation logic is tamper-proof and secure. |
| **🧠 Smart Network** | Intelligent **DNS Helper** pauses installation to help you configure Cloudflare/SSL records correctly. |
| **🔧 Auto-Healer** | Built-in diagnostics tool automatically fixes **Error 500**, Permission issues, and Cache corruption. |
| **♻️ Lifecycle Mgr** | Use the dashboard to **Update**, **Backup**, **Restore**, or **Uninstall** components anytime. |
| **📂 Backup Core** | Creates `.tar.gz` snapshots of your Panel & Database stored safely in `/var/backups/cracken`. |
